# Tongue-and-Cheek
A 2D side-scrolling game for CMSI 402 - Senior Project Laboratory. Developed by Sam Chami, Merci Magallanes, and John Scott

###  What is Tongue and Cheek?
Inspired by QWOP and Getting Over it, 2D games with simple yet ridiculous game mechanics, Tongue and Cheek is a 2D side scroller game following a similar concept. As of right now, Tongue and Cheek is a light-hearted game featuring a single-player character progressing through time constrained individual levels using the mouse and the WASD keys. Tongue and Cheek is created for everyone. 

###  Justification
We want a more interdisciplinary project and believe that a game will satisfy it. Specifically, a 2D game in Unity since it will make us focus not only on the code, but also the aesthetics of the game such as the artwork, music, and potential voice over in the game. We also believe that a game has potential to be more scalable in the sense that we can always improve the graphics and textures of the game and can always add new levels and additional content.
