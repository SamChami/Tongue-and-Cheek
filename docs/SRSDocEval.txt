This is a GREAT job, and you have thought about several important items
with your project.

You can ALWAYS specify more.  Try to think in terms of "if someone else
were to code this project, what would they need to know about the way it
operates?  What information could I provide them so they can be successful
in the implementation?

Move the image and it's text to the Introduction section.

It's fine to make sections for the requirements, but the requirements
still need to be numbered.  For example:

IS:
5.2.1 Graphical User Interface
The user's GUI will be fairly simple, only showing when ...

S/B:
5.2.1   Graphical User Interface (GUI)
5.2.1.1 The user's GUI will be fairly simple, only showing when ...

As part of that, it's a bit ambiguous to have a "GUI" and then call it
the "user's GUI".... also, watch out for weasel words that are hard to
quantify, like "fairly simple".  This requirements actually should be
split into four or five requirements.

You have a few things like that to fix in the document, and try to add
a few more requirements, and you'll be good to go!

Otherwise, nice work!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 14.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.13 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    2.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              25.97 out of 28.18 points = 92.16% which is an A-minus

Keep it up!
